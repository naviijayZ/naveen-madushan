Project Title: IoT-Based Smart Greenhouse Monitoring SystemOverviewDeveloped as a group project for the Instrumentation module, this system provides an autonomous solution for modern agriculture. The project addresses the challenges of manual greenhouse management by using sensors and real-time control to maintain an ideal growing environment without human intervention.+4Core FunctionalitiesAutomated Climate Control: The system continuously monitors temperature and humidity. If the temperature exceeds $40^{\circ}C$ or humidity falls below 60%, it automatically triggers a fogger valve and a pressure pump to stabilize the environment.+2Intelligent Water Management: Using an ultrasonic sensor, the system tracks the water level in the tank. When the level drops below 50%, the refilling motor (M1) is activated automatically to ensure a steady water supply.+4Web-Based Monitoring: Designed a real-time dashboard that allows users to monitor environmental data (Temperature, Humidity, Tank Level) and manually control devices through a local network.+1Safety & Efficiency: The control logic includes safety protocols to prevent irrigation or pump activation if the water level is critically low ($< 50\%$), protecting the hardware from damage.Technical SpecificationsMicrocontroller: ESP32 (Used for central processing and Wi-Fi connectivity).+2Sensors: Industrial DHT11 (Temperature/Humidity) and Ultrasonic sensor (Water Level).Control Unit: Three-channel relay module integrated with transistors for reliable switching.+1Display: Integrated LED dashboard for physical status indication.+1Key ResultsThe system successfully demonstrated its ability to maintain consistent environmental conditions, reducing manual labor and conserving water through precision automation. It serves as a scalable prototype for smart city agriculture and automated farming.
