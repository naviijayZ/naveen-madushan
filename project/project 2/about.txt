Project Title: IoT-Based Smart Electricity Management & Remote Billing System
Overview
Successfully showcased at Waya InnoFest 2025, this project introduces an innovative solution for modernizing energy infrastructure. The Smart Electricity Control System is an integrated IoT platform designed to bridge the gap between utility providers and consumers, ensuring energy efficiency, billing transparency, and seamless remote management.

The Solution
Our system replaces traditional manual billing with a centralized, cloud-based monitoring and control unit. It empowers utility companies to manage the entire power distribution network through a custom-built web interface, significantly reducing operational costs and human error.

Key Technical Features
Real-Time Power Analytics: Continuous monitoring of electricity consumption per household, providing granular data for both users and providers.

Automated Billing & Revenue Protection: Integrated tracking of payment statuses with a direct link to the power supply.

Remote Load Control: Capability to remotely disconnect or reconnect electricity supply via encrypted network signals, specifically designed to handle overdue payments or maintenance.

Intelligent Notification Engine: An automated system that dispatches warning alerts to users regarding high usage or pending bills to ensure uninterrupted service.

Centralized User Management: A secure dashboard for utility providers to add users, monitor load statistics, and analyze consumption patterns using real-time data visualization.

Technical Architecture
The system consists of edge devices (Smart Meters) installed at the consumer end, which communicate with a secure central server. Using real-time network communication, the web platform sends control signals to the hardware, enabling instantaneous response and manual override capabilities from any location.

Impact & Vision
This project serves as a foundation for Smart City Infrastructure. By preventing electricity misuse and automating the billing cycle, it promotes a sustainable energy culture. The platform is built to be scalable and secure, making it a viable solution for large-scale urban energy management.
