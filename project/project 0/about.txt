Project T.R.V: Prototype Tourist Recreation Vehicle (Sustainable Off-Grid Design)OverviewProject T.R.V is a multidisciplinary engineering initiative aimed at revolutionizing Sri Lanka’s tourism infrastructure. This project involved the conceptualization and prototype design of a Tourist Recreation Vehicle (TRV), specifically engineered to provide an affordable, safe, and premium off-grid travel experience. The design integrates modern amenities with sustainable energy solutions to meet the demands of eco-conscious travelers.Core Design FeaturesModular Living Space: Integrated kitchenette and washroom facilities optimized for space efficiency and ergonomic comfort.Off-Grid Power System: A robust solar-powered energy grid designed to support all internal electronics and appliances without relying on external power sources.Safety & Compliance: Engineered with strict adherence to passenger safety standards and structural integrity for long-distance travel across diverse terrains.Technical Specialization: Electrical Power SystemsAs a core part of the engineering team, I led the Electrical Power Profiling and System Sizing. This involved rigorous mathematical modeling and simulations to ensure the vehicle's energy reliability:Load Analysis: Conducted comprehensive power requirements calculations for lighting, water pumps, refrigeration, and auxiliary electronics.Photovoltaic (PV) Sizing: Determined optimal solar panel wattage and mounting configurations to maximize energy harvest under varying tropical weather conditions.Energy Storage System (ESS): Calculated the required battery bank capacity ($Ah$) to sustain the vehicle’s energy demands throughout the night and during low-sunlight periods.Hybrid Power Management: Sized the backup generator output and inverter capacity to handle peak loads and ensure a seamless transition between power sources.Key Learning OutcomesThis project provided hands-on experience in Renewable Energy Integration, Power System Design, and Complex Problem Solving. It required a deep understanding of electrical load balancing, teamwork, and bridging the gap between theoretical calculations and practical vehicle design.
